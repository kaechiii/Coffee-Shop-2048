# Coffeeshop 2048: Build your own aesthetic coffeeshop!

The game takes the concept of “running a coffee shop” with “ endless puzzle game” and mix it together to make a unique casual gameplay experience that can be enjoyable, have good looks, and be played for as long as the player wants. This endless puzzle game also considered addictive because it is challenging in a way that trigger people to continue playing over and over again. Because people always perceived the goal closer than it actually is, they will continuously try to finish it. For example, when people reach '1024' they immediately thought of winning the game. But the truth is, the player is only halfway through the game. The game looks simple and easy at first but as they progress through the game. It gets harder and harder.

Big thanks for amazing creator at flaticon.com to give me the chance to use their assets as sample to define the art style.
